Oh, how much I was wrong when wrote my first reflections here about Git and Github :) 
My best achievement is finally figured out with rebase. yeah, it's great

[Linux CLI, and HTTP](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_linux_cli/1.png)

Just passsed lessons on codeacademy.
I learned linux/bash/http many many times before and at the begining course seemed to me very easy and borring BUT next I realised that I don't know many useful features. So it was great experience. Thank you! 

## Git, GitHub

If to be honest, it was not so much new in this course, because I use Git and GitHub for a long time. But since this is a great oportunty for me to participate in your training program I decide to try my luck ^_^
