Just passsed lessons on codeacademy.
I learned linux/bash/http many many times before and at the begining course seemed to me very easy and borring BUT next I realised that I don't know many useful features. So it was great experience. Thank you! 

## Git, GitHub

If to be honest, it was not so much new in this course, because I use Git and GitHub for a long time. But since this is a great oportunty for me to participate in your training program I decide to try my luck ^_^
