It was hard. Much information isn't clear because there is a lot of it, it is new for me, the task was held in an accelerated mode etc. But I think I should use this in real projects, maybe it would be clear after more practice.

## Memory Pair Game

I couldn't believe that I can do it... until I done:D 
During practice tasks became clear how useful was solving tasks on codecamp and codewars. It is one of the powerful parts of all the course. Only reviews are cooler than this:)

##Offline Web Applications

It was very very hard, I realized how much I should learn before using service workers. My feelings through this course were smth like:

At last I understood what have I doing:D
And now I see that OOP is a very cool and useful thing. 

## Object Oriented JS

![Object Oriented JS](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_js_oop/1.png)

It was very painful, cause I understand that I know nothing. About video explanation, for me it was too fast, I had to play video slower and read a lot of articles to understand this topic.

![codewars](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_js_oop/2.jpg)

Cool site! And very interesting idea with those clans and wars, it is very interesting when you compete instead of just solving tasks.

It was so helpful and interesting task! One of the most useful.

## DOM

It was so helpful course, now I understand that I never didn't know JS :\

No hints were used! But it took a lot of time

## JS Basics

![Intro to JS](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_js_basics/1.png)

Took a lot of time for me at this time, I did all the tasks and it wasn't easy for me.

![freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_js_basics/2.png)

The most useful part of all course I think, cause taking practice and solving tasks by yourself it is the best way to study

![Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_js_basics/3.png)

As to be honest it was difficult for me to understand ALL the material (he speaks very quickly)

Finally learned the basic functionality of JS, now I understand how to solve problems quickly and qualitatively.
Oh, and spread operators are pure magic!


## Responsive Web Design

As always useful, especially the pattern part.

Very interesting game, I didn't know about "flex-flow" before.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

This course has interesting submission of information, perceived easily.

![HTML Academy: first two sections, "Basics of HTML" & "Basics of CSS" free and paid courses done ](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_html_css_intro/2.png)

I couldn't stop in time and passed both courses to the end :) It was the best waste of money of late))) my world will not be the same

## Git Collaboration

Oh, how much I was wrong when wrote my first reflections here about Git and Github :) 
My best achievement is finally figured out with rebase. yeah, it's great


## Linux CLI, and HTTP

![Linux CLI, and HTTP](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_linux_cli/1.png)

Just passsed lessons on codeacademy.
I learned linux/bash/http many many times before and at the begining course seemed to me very easy and borring BUT next I realised that I don't know many useful features. So it was great experience. Thank you! 

## Git, GitHub

If to be honest, it was not so much new in this course, because I use Git and GitHub for a long time. But since this is a great oportunty for me to participate in your training program I decide to try my luck ^_^
