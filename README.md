It was so helpful course, now I understand that I never didn't know JS :\

## JS Basics

![Intro to JS](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_js_basics/1.png)

Took a lot of time for me at this time, I did all the tasks and it wasn't easy for me.

The most useful part of all course I think, cause taking practice and solving tasks by yourself it is the best way to study

As to be honest it was difficult for me to understand ALL the material (he speaks very quickly) 


## Responsive Web Design

![Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_responsive_web_design/1.png)

As always useful, especially the pattern part.

Very interesting game, I didn't know about "flex-flow" before.

This course has interesting submission of information, perceived easily.

![HTML Academy: first two sections, "Basics of HTML" & "Basics of CSS" free and paid courses done ](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_html_css_intro/2.png)

I couldn't stop in time and passed both courses to the end :) It was the best waste of money of late))) my world will not be the same

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

![Linux CLI, and HTTP](https://github.com/nazmariam/kottans-frontend/raw/master/task_linux_cli/1.png)

Just passsed lessons on codeacademy.
I learned linux/bash/http many many times before and at the begining course seemed to me very easy and borring BUT next I realised that I don't know many useful features. So it was great experience. Thank you! 

## Git, GitHub

If to be honest, it was not so much new in this course, because I use Git and GitHub for a long time. But since this is a great oportunty for me to participate in your training program I decide to try my luck ^_^
